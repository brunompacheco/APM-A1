The central A component however consist of resources that are delegating and inspecting work. They pass process instances from one department to another. Since the singular resource has only incoming edges, it must be concerned with the end of the process. It might be a kind of supervisor role that makes a final assertion of a process before it ends.

Other activities however seem to occur in all of the B, C, D departments. Combining these findings with the findings from the other networks we cann assume that the process is structured in such a way, that the A department is a supervision department that performs certain specialized taks. The other departments B, C, D, however perform similar activities (as the jointactivities network suggest) but they never mix. This suggests that a case is delegate by the A resources to one of the departments and this department then fully handles the case. It is in a way not a delegation of cases based on certain types of cases, but just a balancing of cases over all departments."
