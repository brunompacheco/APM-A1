The inner component consists of resources with the first letter A. The nodes in the three outer components are connected only to themselves and the inner A component, but not to the other outer components.

The central A component however consist of resources that are delegating and inspecting work. They pass process instances from one department to another. Since the singular resource has only incoming edges, it must be concerned with the end of the process. It might be a kind of supervisor role that makes a final assertion of a process before it ends. However this node is not involved in most cases, as its connection is rather weak."

The strong connection between the _Alexander_ and _Ava_ resources suggests that Alexander is in a leadership position and Ava might be her secretary, as most of the work is subcontracted."

From the subcontracting network we have seen that in the outer components, much of the work is subcontracted, which explains the involvement of many different resources of each component we can see in the working-together network."

Other activities however seem to occur in all of the B, C, D departments. Combining these findings with the findings from the other networks we cann assume that the process is structured in such a way that the A department is a supervision department that performs certain specialized taks. The other departments B, C, D, however perform similar activities (as the jointactivities network suggest) but they never mix. This suggests that a case is delegate by the A resources to one of the departments and this department then fully handles the case. It is in a way not a delegation of cases based on certain types of cases, but just a balancing of cases over all departments."
