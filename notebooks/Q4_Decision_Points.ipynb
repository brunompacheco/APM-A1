PM4Py offers a decision tree module, that creates a decision tree predicting the end event of a case from the case properties. Since we know that eventually all patients will be discharged from our previous analysis, most of the cases will have a discharge end event. From this we cannot infer which treatment was performed before the discharge. Because of this, before creating the decision tree, we will cut off all traces when a certain event occurs. This event is one of a set of events that describe the treatment of the patient. The events included in this set can be seen below. They are either related to a certain kind of treatment, or a discharge. The discharge events are included for cases that do not recieve any treatment."
